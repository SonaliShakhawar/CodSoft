            Great personalities are not born every day;
            they are born once in a century and are remembered for millennials
            to come. One such great personality that we will always be proud
            of is Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. His full name was Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen
            Abdul Kalam, born in Rameswaram of Madras Presidency on 15th October
            1931 and died on July 27, 2015, Shillong. He was an Indian Scientist
            and also a politician leader, who later became the 11th President of India.
            He played an important role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear
            weapons program.Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with 
            the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition 
            Indian National Congress

            Born on 15th October 1931 at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, Dr. Avul Pakir
            Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, specialized in Aeronautical Engineering from Madras
            Institute of Technology. Dr. Kalam made significant contribution as Project
            Director to develop India's first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III)
            which successfully injected the Rohini satellite in the near earth orbit in July
            1980 and made India an exclusive member of Space Club.He thus came to be known as 
            the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and 
            launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, 
            and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since 
            the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

        When we talk about APJ Abdul Kalam’s education, it is quite prominent that he
        always wanted to make a successful career in Aviation. Becoming a fighter pilot 
        was once his dearest dream, which was not fulfilled as he couldn’t reach the final
        merit of IAF. After completing his higher education, Kalam joined the DRDO 
        (Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development 
        Organisation) as a scientist and late in the early 1960s, worked with the 
        INCOSPAR (Indian National Committee for Space Research) under Vikram Sarabhai,
        a renowned space scientist.

    <p>
        Even though he got immense opportunities to design hovercrafts and small helicopters, 
        he was never convinced and always aimed for something bigger and there was no failure
        in this world that could stop him. Later, Abdul Kalam started independently working 
        on expandable rocket projects at DRDO. Things took a magnificent turn when he received 
        transfer orders to the ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization) where he started as a 
        project director of SLV-III, India’s first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle, which 
        deployed the Rohini satellite into orbit the earth in July 1980.

    <h3>APJ Abdul Kalam’s Education: Lessons to Remember</h3>
    <p>
        <span>1. Be Prepared For Life :</span> It isn’t always necessary that your life will exactly be like 
        you want it to be, instead let your life take its course and go with the flow. Do not 
        forget, everything that happens happens for a reason. APJ Abdul Kalam’s education always
        taught us to never allow our failure to take over our lives but rather always have a 
        ‘Plan B’ approach.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>2. Leadership :</span> A good leader acknowledges the contribution, shoulders the responsibility
        and never blames for failures and gives credit for success. Taking undue credit for 
        something you haven’t done or achieved does not make you better and may influence bad 
        qualities in your juniors.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>3. A Vision of your Own :</span> One of the most influential factors that greatly accelerates
        civilization is people having a vision about everything they do, what matters to them
        the most, how well can they reap their rewards and giving them a definition in their 
        lives.
